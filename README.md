 How to play:
WASD to move, space to fly higher, E to collect energy, Q to light the lamp up, R to stop the enemy.

Through the seasons, to the end.



Notes:
Although I say it's four seasons, two of the scenes won't push into my GitHub for some reason. 
It says that play.data is too big. I apologize for that.
